# React State : An Overview

When building modern web applications with React, one of the most fundamental concepts you'll encounter is **state**. State allows components to store and manage dynamic data that changes over time, helping to create interactive and responsive user interfaces. Understanding how state works in React and how to manage it effectively is key to writing scalable and maintainable applications.

In this blog post, we’ll dive into **React state** and explore different strategies for **state management** in React applications.

## What is React State?

In React, state refers to an object that determines how a component renders and behaves. Unlike props, which are passed down from parent to child components and are immutable, state is **local** to a component and can change over time. When the state changes, React re-renders the component, ensuring the UI reflects the latest state.

### Example: Using State in a Functional Component

Here’s a simple example using `useState` hook to manage the state in a functional component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Declare a state variable 'count' with an initial value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
